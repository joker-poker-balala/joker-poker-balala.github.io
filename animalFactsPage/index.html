       <h2>Facts</h2>
            <p>
                Musk ox live in the Arctic tundra. 
                They stand 4 to 5 feet at the shoulder, and weigh around 500 to 800 pounds.
                They live in herds with two to three dozen members.<br>
                The musk ox is actually more closely related to sheep and goats than cows. 
                It is also the only species in the <span class="scientific">Ovibos</span> genus.<br>
                They feed on Arctic willow, woody plants, lichen, and moss. During the summer, they also eat Arctic flowers and grasses.
                In the winter, they use their hooves to dig through the snow.
