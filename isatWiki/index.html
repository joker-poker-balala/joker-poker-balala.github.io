        <h3>About</h3>
        <p class="char">In Stars and Time focuses on a party of five saving the country of Vaugarde
        from being frozen in time.<br> The person behind the curse is the King, who wants to keep
        the country perfect and unchanging.</p>
        <img src="Death_King.gif" class="rimg"></img>
        <p class="char">Following an uncomfortably close encounter with a trap, 
        party leader Siffrin discovers they are actually stuck in a time loop, 
        able to start the day over again with nobody else the wiser.

        But what seems like a handy trick to ensure victory 
        quickly begins to weigh on Siffrin as he experiences the loop over and over 
        with no end in sight. 
        Unwilling to open up to their friends and companions, 
        and with the literal weight of the world on their shoulders, 
        can Siffrin find a way to break the loop before it breaks him?</p>
