                            Siffrin is the main character of the game, and the character you play as. 
                            He serves as the party's leader and trap master, since he is fast enough to dodge traps.
                            He joined the party fourth, after Odile but before Bonnie, by protecting the group from a particularly strong Sadness.
                            They also lost their eye protecting Bonnie.
                            They like puns, and will incorporate them into their conversations.
                            He also likes theater, and his internal monologue reflects this.
                            He cares very deeply for the party, but hides a lot of secrets from them.

                            Mirabelle is a Housemaiden of Change, 
                            and the "chosen one" to stop the country being frozen.
                            She is immune to the curse. She was also the first person in the group, having been
                            the only one to escape from from the King's inital takeover. 
                            is shy, polite, and caring.

                        <li>
                            Isabeau grew up in the city of Jouvente. 
                            In his childhood, he was an extremely gifted student, 
                            but incredibly shy and frequently paralyzed by anxiety. 
                            Unsatisfied with his state of being, 
                            he went to one of Jouvente's Houses in order to Change, 
                            thus becoming the person he is in the present. 
                            after this, Isabeau joined Jouvente's Defenders 
                            out of admiration for their dedication to the community. 
                            He passed his entrance exam with flying colors.
                            He was the second person to join the party.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Odile is described as curious and very perceptive;
                            and although she sometimes acts as if she doesn't,
                            she does in fact care for the party. 
                            She likes participating alongside them,
                            such as imitating Siffrin's bumping into counters noises,
                            or teaching Bonnie to make onigiri.
                            She's quick to notice when something's unusual or weird, 
                            and although she does not often call it out, she does want to be supportive.
                            She hates having secrets kept from her.
                            She was the third person to join the party.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Bonnie is described as "young and angry";
                            as a kid, they have a rather childish personality.
                            They love cooking, so they get easily excited when someone mentions food or being hungry.
                            They feel upset whenever they feel as though they've disappointed someone,
                            such as when Odile doesn't say anything about the snacks,
                            or not noticing when Siffrin is upset.
