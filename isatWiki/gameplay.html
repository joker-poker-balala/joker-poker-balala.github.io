        In Stars and Time is a turn-based RPG that uses a rock-paper-scissors based combat system.
        <img src="hands.png" class="centerimg"></img>
        Each enemy and character uses one "type," called Crafts, to deal damage.
        Rarely, people can use multiple types of Crafts (dual wielding Scissors and Paper, for example).
        There are also other types of Craft that aren't used in battle; rather they're used for everyday things.
        Each type of Craft has a special name, and traits assigned to it:
        <ul class="char">
            <li>Scissors/Piercing Craft</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a type used in battle. It focuses on raw damage by attacking one enemy multiple times,
                    or attacking multiple enemies. It's also used to make allies faster.
                    people who use Scissors Craft are described as determined, brave and honest, 
                    but also as callous, aimless and manipulative.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Paper/Creative Craft</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is a type used in battle. It focuses on getting the advantage by
                        modifying allies and enemies' resistances.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Rock/Protecting Craft</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is a type used in battle. It's used for tanking hits,
                        lowering enemies' attack damage, and boosting allies' defense.
                        People who use Rock Craft are described as patient, honest, loyal and very gullible.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Body Craft</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Body Craft is the use of Craft to modify one's body and appearance. Though some people use Body Craft to subtly change some details of their appearance, 
                        like their height, a lot of people go through Body Craft in order to get an entirely different body.
                        In the past, it took around one year to make big modifications to one's body, 
                        but recent advancements in the understanding of Body Craft has shortened this time to a month or so.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Time Craft</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Time Craft is the use of Craft to bend time to one's will. 
                        It is the Craft type used by The King to freeze Vaugarde in time (known as the King's Curse).
                        Time Craft is the subject of a lot of research outside of Vaugarde on account of its potential uses, 
                        but also its dangers: it could be used to make people age slower or faster, 
                        make bodies younger or older, hasten the growth of crops and plants, 
                        but also go back in time and potentially rewrite history itself.
